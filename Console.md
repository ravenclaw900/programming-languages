| Rust                 | Yes, Cargo      | Yes              | Compiled             | Medium      | Yes   | Very stringent, sometimes hard to develop, memory safe, no undefined behavior, can use C libraries, fast binaries. | Use for most console apps in general, especially if they need to be fast and lightweight. |
| Go                   | Yes, `go get`   | Yes              | Compiled             | Large       | Yes   | Large supported ecosystem (by Google), simple and easy to learn, easy to create coroutines/threads.                | Use for most console apps that involve APIs or other web connectivity.                    |

| C++                  | Not officially  | Yes              | Compiled             | Small       | Yes   | Superset of C with classes, mostly backwards-compatible with C libraries.                                          | Use for simple console apps, games, or anything more low-level than Rust.                 |
| Python               | Yes, PIP        | Yes              | Interpreted          | N/A         | No    | Cross-platform, easy to develop.                                                                                   | Use for scripts that should be cross-platform and don't need to be incredibly fast.       |
| Lua                  | Not officially  | Yes              | Interpreted          | N/A         | No    | Very lightweight, easy to embed, only data structure is tables, no OOP.                                            | Use for embedded scripts in any of the above compiled languages, especially C.            |
| Bash                 | No              | No               | Interpreted          | N/A         | No    | Only runs on *nix systems, uses binaries already on system to do anything.                                         | Use for most *nix scripts where the "sophistication" of Python isn't necessary.           |
