| JavaScript | N/A                        | Bundled with all browsers.                        | Use for fairly simple websites where not much JS is needed.                                                                  |
| TypeScript | N/A                        | JS with type checking, transpiles back into JS.   | Use for most web apps with a build system.                                                                                   |
| JQuery     | 87.9 KB                    | Extension to JS to allow simple DOM manipulation. | Anything that can be done in JQuery can be done in vanilla JS, while it makes life simpler it's probably not worth the size. |
| Svelte     | N/A                        | Fairly simple reactive JS framework.              | Use for most web apps in general.                                                                                            |
| Vue        | 93.4 KB                    | "Adoptable" JS framework.                         | Use for anything more than what Svelte can provide.                                                                          |
| React      | (React + React-DOM) 128 KB | Full-featured JS framework.                       | Almost never use, only if you need more than what Vue provides.                                                              |
