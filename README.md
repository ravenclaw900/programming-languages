# Programming Languages

This provides an outline (mainly for me) of when to use a specific programming language and the tradeoffs of each one.

For console apps, see [Console.md](./Console.md)  
For JS frameworks, see [Frameworks.md](./Frameworks.md)

Disclaimer: These are **my opinions** on which each programming language should be used for. Feel free to disagree with me.
